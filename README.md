# Summarising stratigraphic data using principal curves

This is a public repository for a paper I am writing on the use of principal curves for summarising stratigraphic palaeoecological data. The paper is being written in markdown with embedded R code. **knitr** is used to covert the embedded R code to outputs used in the paper in a markdown source file. The `pandoc()` **knitr** function is then used to render the markdown source to PDF via LaTeX. This stage uses the default Pandoc LaTeX template currently, but I plan to modify that template to give nicer rendered output.

This is a work in progress *and* an experiment in writing a paper in the open using Github and the ideals of reproducible research; if you have any comments or suggestions uses the [issues tab](https://github.com/gavinsimpson/palaeopcurvepaper/issues) to make them.
